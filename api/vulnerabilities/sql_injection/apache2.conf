# This is the main Apache server configuration file. It contains the
# configuration directives that give the server its instructions.
# See http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/ for detailed information about
# the directives and /usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian about Debian specific
# hints.
#
#
# Summary of how the Apache 2 configuration works in Debian:
# The Apache 2 web server configuration in Debian is quite different to
# upstream's suggested way to configure the web server. This is because Debian's
# default Apache2 installation attempts to make adding and removing modules,
# virtual hosts, and extra configuration directives as flexible as possible, in
# order to make automating the changes and administering the server as easy as
# possible.

# It is split into several files forming the configuration hierarchy outlined
# below, all located in the /etc/apache2/ directory:
#
# /etc/apache2/
# ├── apache2.conf
# │   └── ...
# ├── mods-enabled
# │   ├── *.load
# │   └── *.conf
# ├── conf-enabled
# │   └── *.conf
# └── sites-enabled
#     └── *.conf
#
#
# * apache2.conf is the main configuration file (this file). It puts the pieces
#   together by including all remaining configuration files when starting up the
#   web server.
#
# * mods-enabled/ and conf-enabled/ contain respectively the modules and
#   configuration files enabled for this site. They are activated by symlinking
#   available configuration files from their respective *-available/ counterparts.
#   These should be managed by using our helpers
#   a2enmod/a2dismod, a2ensite/a2dissite and a2enconf/a2disconf. See
#   their respective man pages for detailed information.
#
# * Alternatively, the full contents of apache2.conf can be customized.
#   Attention! If you do this, make sure that you have proper knowledge about
#   the Apache configuration file structure and syntax. A mistake in the
#   customization of apache2.conf may cause your web server to fail to start up.
#
# * Including other files from apache2.conf is not recommended, instead, use
#   the appropriate directory (mod-enabled, conf-enabled, sites-enabled) and
#   include the configuration files from there.

# Global configuration
#

# ServerName gives the name and port that the server uses to identify itself.
# This can often be determined automatically, but we recommend you specify
# it explicitly to prevent problems during startup.
#
# If your host doesn't have a registered DNS name, enter its IP address here.
#
ServerName localhost

# ErrorLog and LogLevel
#
ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
